# Hospital Patient Experience Analysis (2017–2018)

This project analyzes hospital patient experience survey data across **7 U.S. states** (AL, AR, AK, AZ, CT, CO, CA) covering the period **July 2017 – June 2018**. The dataset includes **695 hospitals** and multiple patient experience measures such as communication, cleanliness, discharge information, and likelihood to recommend.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a data analyst approaches:
- **Data quality assessment**
- **Metric reliability**
- **State-level performance patterns**
- **Clear, business-ready storytelling**

Rather than comparing individual hospitals (which would be misleading due to uneven representation—California alone contributes nearly half of the hospitals), this project focuses on **state-level insight and reliability-aware interpretation**.

## 📌 Project Objectives
1. **Identify the reliability of survey data** by decoding footnote indicators.
2. **Understand state-level patient experience trends** without inflating or suppressing results due to skewed hospital counts.
3. **Communicate insights clearly** using clean visuals and an emphasis on data quality.
4. **Demonstrate SQL, Looker Studio, and storytelling skills** in a way hiring managers care about.

## 🗂 Key Deliverables

### ✔ Executive Summary  
High-level overview of data quality, state insights, and recommendations (see project page).

### ✔ Visualizations (Looker Studio → Screenshots)  
Created visuals include:
- State-level reliability heatmap  
- Distribution of reliable vs. unreliable records  
- Average patient experience scores by measure group  
- Trend/variance charts across measure categories  

These are embedded directly on the GitHub Pages project site.

### ✔ SQL Transformations  
SQL scripts used to create:
- Footnote extraction + standardization  
- Reliability flags  
- Measure group mappings  
- State-level aggregated views  

_All SQL scripts are available in the `/sql/` folder._
