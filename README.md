## ⭐ Overview

This project analyzes hospital patient experience survey data across **7 U.S. states**  
**(AL, AR, AK, AZ, CT, CO, CA)** covering the period:

📅 **July 2017 – June 2018**  
🏥 **695 hospitals**  
📊 **Multiple patient experience measures**

The goal of this analysis is to tell a clear, meaningful story about patient experience while ensuring **data reliability** remains central to the interpretation.

This page provides:
1. **The insights**  
2. **The visuals**  
3. **The narrative behind the findings**  

All SQL, data cleaning steps, and documentation are linked but intentionally secondary — the focus is on **insight, clarity, and communication**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Evaluate **data quality** using footnote-based reliability indicators  
- Identify **state-level trends** in patient experience  
- Understand variation across core themes like:  
  - Communication  
  - Cleanliness  
  - Discharge information  
  - Likelihood to recommend  
- Present insights visually and clearly for stakeholders  
- Avoid misleading comparisons due to skewed hospital counts (e.g., California making up ~50% of the dataset)

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

Patient experience surveys influence:
- Medicare reimbursement  
- Quality ratings  
- Public hospital rankings  
- Community trust  

But the results are only meaningful **if the underlying data is reliable**.

This project begins by identifying and quantifying **unreliable & footnoted data**, then builds insights from a clean, trustworthy foundation.

# 🔧 Data Quality & Reliability

**Before** interpreting patient experience results, the dataset was evaluated for reliability:

### ✔ Footnotes were decoded into:
- Insufficient sample size  
- Partial year data  
- Suppressed or unreliable values  
- No footnote (fully reliable)  

### ✔ Each row was labeled:
- **Reliable**
- **Unreliable**

This allows all charts and insights to be filtered or annotated accordingly.

> Data reliability is the foundation of the story.

## 📍 1. Data Reliability by State

**Purpose:** Understand which states have the highest % of reliable survey records.

➡ Reveals blind spots in survey participation and data completeness.
